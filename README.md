# Flatten
This library, implemented in Node.js, will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers.

## Execution
It can be executed from the command line, passing in the array as the first command line argument:  
`node app.js [1,[2,3],[[4],5]]`

## Tests
Tests are written using Jasmine and can be executed with either `npm test` or `jasmine`.
